\section{Conference Highlights}
This was my first time took part in such an awesome academic conference. Most of my time spent in Deep Learning \& Computational Photography related topics. However, I would also update some topics that I found interesting.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Around 10,000 people attend this year's conference. About 1300 papers were accepted in CVPR 2019. Reports saying number of attendees projected in 2035 will be over 1 million :). See Figure \ref{fig:Conf_HL1}.
    \begin{figure}[h!]

        \caption{projection of attendees to reach 1 million by 2035}
        \label{fig:Conf_HL1}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item Comparing to last year, the number of papers accepted in CVPR 2019 increased about 30\%. However, due to the fact that the number of papers submitted this year has increased 56.2\%, thus the paper acceptance rate reduced 4\% this year. See Figure \ref{fig:Conf_HL2}.
    \begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/Image2.png}
        \caption{papers acceptance rate is 4\% lower in CVPR 2019}
        \label{fig:Conf_HL2}
    \end{figure}
    
    \newpage
    \item Some of hot keywords in CVPR 2019 submission: Image, detection, 3d, object, video, segmentation, adversarial, recognition, visual. See Figure \ref{fig:Conf_HL3}
    \begin{figure}[ht!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/Image3.jpeg}
        \caption{hot submission keywords CVPR 2018 vs. CVPR 2019}
        \label{fig:Conf_HL3}
    \end{figure}
    
    \item More Meta-learning, One-shot/Few-shots learning, Graph Neural Networks papers started to emerge this year.
    \item It's great to see a lot of fast pace improvement towards real-life low level image processing field.
    \item Network Architecture Search was also another very popular topic. Great to see a burst of diverse solutions in this field.
    \item Generative Adversarial Network was a hot topic again. Exciting progress were made again this year.
