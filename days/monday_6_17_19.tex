\subsection{Workshop: Computational Photography}
Light Field Super-Resolution A Benchmark\\

Low Rank Poisson Denoising(LRPD)\\

\subsubsection{Professor Peyman Milanfar: Computation + Photography How the mobile phone became a camera}
    - Modern Mobile Imaging: Burst Photography. ?Burst Video?\\
    - Classical camera pipeline -demosaicing (Merging)\\
    - Replace demosaicing with multiple frames\\
    - Pixel Shifting\\
    - Merge: Nonlinear Kernel Regression\\
    - Merge High-res Grid -> up to 2x\\
    - Source of motion imaging: 1. OIS, 2. (rough) alignment by (Natural) Physiological Tremor\\
    - use OIS simulate tremor!!!!\\
    - Aliasing + Phase diversity -> Multi-frame Super-res\\
    - Visual System also appears to do super-resolution\\
    - Handheld Multi-Frame Super-Resolution (Why not using GAN)\\
    - Zoom Use Case: to zoom more: Upscale SISR, using RAISR\\
    - Other Challenge in Computational Photography: Curation (NIMA for Aesthetic Quality, NIMA for Technical Quality)\\
    - Camera Understand the Scene and the User\\
    - Night Sight Mode: Super Night Sight on Merge Methods. ML on White Balance\\

\subsubsection{Denoising}
    - Hanyang University\\
    - Hierarchical Structure\\
    - Iterative down-sampling and up-sampling\\
    - Down-up Block\\

\subsubsection{Style-based GAN: Kerras}
    - Progressive GAN\\
    - BigGAN\\
    - Pose-Guided Face Rotation\\
    - Mask-Guided Portrait Editing\\

\subsubsection{Image Coloring Challenge}

\subsubsection{Opportunity Chiuman Ho, Director of AI: Imaging in the Dark}
    - l1 > l2 since l2 penalize a lot on large loss\\
    - Feature Loss\\
